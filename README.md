FOSS EKV2.6 Compact Model 

The EKV2.6 MOSFET compact model has had a considerable impact on the academic and industrial community of analog integrated circuit design, since its inception in 1996. The model is available as a free open-source software (FOSS) tool coded in Verilog-A. The present depository provides a short review of foundations of the model and shows its capabilities via characterization and modeling based on a test chip in 180 nm CMOS fabricated via Europractice.
